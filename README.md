  <h1>ðŸ“Š Data Science Projects Portfolio</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my curated portfolio of data science projects, developed as part of my ongoing <strong>Postgraduate Program in Data Science</strong>. These projects reflect my passion for blending analytical thinking with real-world problem solving, and demonstrate my ability to apply statistical, programming, and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights.</p>

  <h2>ðŸ§  Core Modules Completed</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Python for Data Science:</strong> Data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy, exploratory data analysis, and visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.</li>
    <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and statistical significance applied to business scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Predictive Modelling:</strong> Regression, classification, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, accuracy, precision, and recall.</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Implementation of supervised learning algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>ðŸŽ¯ Objective</h2>
  <p>These projects are part of my journey to integrate <strong>data science into QA leadership</strong>, enabling data-driven decision making, predictive quality assurance, and strategic insights. I aim to transition into roles that leverage both <strong>technical excellence and business impact</strong>.</p>
